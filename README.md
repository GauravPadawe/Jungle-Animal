# Jungle-Animal
## Question By AnnaGajdova from forums ##

You are in the middle of a jungle. Suddenly you see an animal coming to you. 
Here is what you should do if the animal is:

zebra >> "Try to ride a zebra!"
cheetah >> If you are faster than a cheetah: "Run!" 
            If you are not: "Stay calm and wait!". 
            The speed of a cheetah is 115 km/h.
anything else >> "Introduce yourself!"

Define a procedure, jungle_animal, that takes as input a string and a number, an animal and your speed (in km/h), and prints out what to do.
